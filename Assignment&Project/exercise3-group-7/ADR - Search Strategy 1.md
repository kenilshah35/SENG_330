# Search strategy - 1 by Observation Id

## Status

Accepted

## Context

A method to search our list of whale observation was needed. Searching the list by Observation ID returns a specific observation. Furthermore, Observation ID is the primary key for Observations, therefore searching for an ID is guareenteed to return a single Observation.

## Decision

Added a functionality to search the list of whale obsevervation by their observation ID's. This was done using an anonymous comparator method inside the monitor class. Searching the list using the unique observation Id generated for each observation seemed like a logical strategy as every ID is unique.

## Consequences

Adding this search strategy should allow the users of the system to search for a specific observation exists in the system. Using a nested anonymous comparator implementation will preserve encapsulation, while still keeping the code simple and readable.
However, we may consider altering this implementation in the future. Currently our ID field for Observations is a complex string, auto generated by the constructor. We may wish to alter this in the future to a more human-friendly field to ease the searching process.
