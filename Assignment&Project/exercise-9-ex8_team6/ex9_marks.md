# Total:  / 15

# Implementation for each question (0-10). 
There are 2 marks for each of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

2 marks are for solving the exercise (tests pass), using the functional and streaming concepts in Chapter 9 appropriate. Marks will be deducted for odd, non-Chapter 9 solutions, no testing or inadequate testing, inappropriate design choices, or hard to follow solutions. A solution that does not pass the test or does not exist gets 0. There is no need to write tests for the Scala component (5).

# Code correctness and understanding of Java concepts, parsing  (0-5)
- [ ] 5 - 4, and the class design is appropriate. 
- [ ] 4 - 3, and the parsing works well and data types and structures are reasonable. 
- [ ] 3 - All Java code well written and commented. Unit tests exist. Gradle file works. Parsing a bit odd, data structures and types seem inappropriate.
- [ ] 2 - Code does not compile or not possible to run. Missing many aspects; lacks insight and evidence of work.
- [ ] 1 - Does not compile. Little evidence of work; mostly missing components.
- [ ] 0 - not handed in or not available.
