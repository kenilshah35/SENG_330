## Exercise 2

In this exercise, the five of you will brainstorm some simple requirements of the whale monitoring system, and create a basic information-hiding design for the back end system. Use at least the following domain elements: `Whale`, `Observation`, `Reporter` (you might need to add helper classes or new classes; justify these in the ADR). Think carefully about what should be immutable, what should be hidden, and what basic operations those classes should have. 

Begin by sketching out the classes and their responsibilities: what is Whale doing? What is Reporter responsible for? 

Stub out some Java classes - the src directory here should help get you started.

Use a UML Object diagram to show how the system should look when it is running. 

Capture your important decisions in the ADR template.

### Learning Objectives

- use of enumerated types
- practical encapsulation
- use of copy constructor

### Deliverables: 
- fill in the ADR template as discussed in class.
- create an object diagram for the system at runtime.
- create skeleton Java code that will implement the design.
- include a Driver.java file with a main() method that can get the system running.

## Due
- We will mark the last commit made before **September 25 at 11:59pm**. If that last commit was a mess, let us know. Make sure your code compiles!
- By midnight September 27, submit your team peer review form (link to follow). We will discuss the peer rating form in class.
